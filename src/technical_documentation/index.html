        <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.</p>
        <p>Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.</p>

        <p>In 2002 Aaron Swartz created atx, "the true structured text format". Swartz and John Gruber then worked together to create the Markdown language in 2004, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".</p>
        <p>Its key design goal is readability – that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions, unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.</p>

        <p>Markdown has been characterised by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. People developed these mostly driven by the need for additional features on top of the base syntax—such as tables, footnotes, definition lists (technically HTML description lists), and Markdown inside HTML blocks. The behavior of some of these diverges from the reference implementation. At the same time, a number of ambiguities in the informal specification have attracted attention. These issues spurred the creation of tools such as Babelmark to compare the output of various implementations, and an effort by some developers of Markdown parsers for standardisation. However, Gruber has argued that complete standardization would be mistaken: "Different sites (and people) have different needs. No one syntax would make all happy."</p>
        <p>Some common Markdown flavors and standards, along with sample text, follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CommonMark</li>
            <pre><code>Markdown: Syntax
================
# This is an H1 #
## This is an H2 ##
### This is an H3 ###</code></pre>
          <li>reStructuredText</li>
            <pre><code>This is an H1
=============
This is an H2
-------------
This is an H3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
          <li>Markdown-it</li>
            <pre><code># This is an H1 #
## This is an H2 ##
### This is an H3 ###</code></pre>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="Syntax" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Syntax</h1></header>
        <p>Some Text</p>
        <code></code>
